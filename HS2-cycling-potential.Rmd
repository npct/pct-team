# Introduction

The original plan for this analysis was to assess the cycling potential along the HS2 route.
The new plan, based on feedback from the DfT about what would be most useful, is to assess the cycling potential along the *cycle path network* designed by consultants to be constructed in tandem with construction of the HS2 route. We refer to this network, which has a **total length of 3,213 km** as the HS2 Cycle Path Network (HS2CN).

## Descriptive analysis of route

An overview of this plan is presented in Figure \@ref(fig:overview). The proposal is split the HS2CN into 6 phases, including Phase 1, Phase 2 (East and West), Peak District links and HS3. The analysts at Royal Haskoning have done some preliminary analysis on the proposed HS2CN, which is briefly summarised below for context.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, message = FALSE}
source("R/load-infrastructure.R")
over_table = hs2net@data %>% 
  group_by(HS2_Phase) %>% 
  summarise(
    `Lenth (km)` = sum(Shape_Leng) / 1000,
    `Main county` = names(which.max(table(CountyUA))),
    `Main nearest city` = names(which.max(table(NearestCit)))
  )
kable(over_table, digits = 1, row.names = F, caption = "Summary of the length and main county/city related to each Phase of the planned cycle network surrounding HS2.")
```

# The propensity to cycle around the HS2 cycle network

The first stage in the analysis was to subset the Route Network layer generated by the PCT to include only segments within a close distance to the HS2CN. This was set to 10 km, based on the knowledge that most people will not cycle more than around 8 miles to work (10 km Euclidead distance corresponds to around 8 mile route distance, depending on how circuitous the roads are in the local area).

To do this, all PCT regions that the HS2CN passed through were identified (Figure \@ref(fig:regions)).
<!-- The distance of cycle paths associated with these regions is summarised in Table @\ref -->
These were: Buckinghamshire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, Greater Manchester, 
 Hertfordshire, Leicestershire, Liverpool City Region, London, 
 Northamptonshire, North Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Oxfordshire, 
 South Yorkshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, West Midlands and
 West Yorkshire.

# hs2sf = st_as_sf(hs2net)

hs2buff = stplanr::buff_geo(hs2points, width = 10000)
# hs2buff = rgeos::gBuffer(hs2net, width = 10000)
regions_sel = regions[hs2net,]
region_names = regions$Region

<!-- The route network was extracted from our analysis for each of these regions using the following commands: -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->

<!-- for(i in 2:length(region_names)){ -->
<!--   f = paste0("../pct-data/", region_names[i], "/rnet.Rds") -->
<!--   rnet = bind(rnet, readRDS(f)) -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- saveRDS(rnet, "../pct-bigdata/rnet-england-msoa.Rds") -->
<!-- ``` -->

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# rnet = readRDS("../pct-bigdata/rnet-england-msoa.Rds")
# rnet = rnet[hs2buff,]
# saveRDS(rnet, "input-data/rnet-hs2.Rds")
rnet = readRDS("input-data/rnet-hs2.Rds")

  tm_lines(col = "HS2_Phase", lwd = 3) +

## Overall pattern at the national level

An overview of the overlap between the HS2CN and the national Route Network layer produced by the PCT is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:rnetover). Overall there is a good degree of correspondence between the two route network layers. 

```{r rnetover, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="National overview of the overlap between the Route Network generated by the PCT and the HS2CN. The Route Network is displayed in dark blue, with thickness corresponding to cycling potential under the Government Target scenario, with a maximum of 5000 and a minimum of 1 estimated commuters per segment. "}
include_graphics("figures/rnet-pct-hs2-regions.png")
```

At the national level, the most noticeable difference between the HS2CN and the result generated by the PCT is the density of the Route Network in urban/rural areas. Although the HS2CN clearly was designed to be denser in urban areas, the proportion of cycling potential estimated by the PCT that is in urban areas appears to be greater than the proportion of HS2CN that is in urban areas, by distance.

What follows is an analysis of notable areas where there is a notable divergence between the results of the PCT and the HS2CN. A simplified version of the results has been made on-line for policy-makers to explore, at www.pct.bike/hs2cn-overly.

## London to Birmingham

Between London and Birmingham, there appears to be more cycling potential directly to the west of the HS2CN than along its main route or to the east, implying extension in this direction (particularly between Bicester and Banbury, for example) could be an effect way to improve the utility of the HS2CN for commuting. The B4100 could be a potential candidate for such a route were it to be build on-road, as it follows a fairly direct path but stays away from the M40 and the existing rail track in along the travel corridor (Figure \@ref(fig:banbi)).
