# Abstract {-}

Cycling is already an effective means of transport for millions of people worldwide. In the future, evidence suggests that a shift to cycling as the main mode for short trips could transform urban transport systems, making them healthier, cleaner and more socially equitable. Building on academic evidence, political attention and funding has been allocated to encourage cycling many cities and countries. However, cycling is still marginalised in many transport planning institutions. This paper explores this issue, with the aim of identifying opportunities for embedding cycling at every stage of the planning process. A brief review of the history of transport planning illuminates this marginalisation, and suggests institutional restructuring may be needed to ensure active travel is taken seriously. Less politically disruptive opportunities for embedding cycling are also explored. These include innovative 'soft infrastructure' products, open source digital tools, and new technologies for monitoring and evaluation. We conclude that these opportunities must be taken at every stage of the transport planning process for active travel to become central to the discipline.

It is well-known that the transport system in the majority of settlements across the world are not conducive to environmental sustainability or human health. Much has been written about this problem [e.g. @rouse_energy:_1975;@peake_transport_1994;@han_assessment_2008]. Many grand remedies have been proposed [e.g. @wang_strategic_2013;@raux_transport_2010;@cuenot_prospect_2012]. But such high-level evidence-based recommendations have seldom been implemented in practice. Perhaps part of the reason for this research-policy mismatch is that the recommendations are directed towards world leaders and not transport planning professionals, who actually influence local decisions on the ground. Furthermore, the remedies suggested in the afforementioned papers risk being seen as too general and conceptual to be easily translated into practice. For this reason the present paper has a narrow focus on a single mode of transport. In the context of seemingly intractable environmental and health problems associated with transport at the global level, the paper explores solutions at the level of local and regional transport plans.

Much has been written about how to make transport systems overall more sustainable, and the topic has become a prominent concern in the transport literature [@schwanen_scientific_2011;@banister_sustainable_2008]. Still, such broad academic advocacy has been slow to filter into real-world transport plans. This paper is deliberately more focussed: its focus on active transport modes, and cycling in particular, results in actionable guidance *for transport planners* and academics actively engaging with the planning process. This approach is designed to complement, rather than replace, the high level or purely conceptual advice contained in position papers. Transport planning is a *practical* discipline, so the paper deliberately focusses on factors over which transport planners have some control (e.g. not the state of the economy or national political priorities).

A premise of this paper is the perceived disconnect between the discipline of transport planning and transport policies. An example of this disconnect is the UK, where decades of academic evidence culminating in a government-commissioned white paper by @goodwin_transport_1991, have been sidelined by successive governments in favour of road expansion. This has continued into the 21^st^ century: despite letter signed by 32 leading transport academics urging him not to [@millward_professors_2013], George Osborne announced in 2016 a large increase in the budget allocated to roads (£15 billion over the next 5 years, amounting to over £50 per person per year), while cutting central government funding for cycling (to £0.3 billion or less than £2 per person per year) [@upfold_cycling_2016].
This example illustrates the wider point that transport research often fails to filter into policy *at all*, let alone at the rapid pace needed to mitigate the worst impacts of systems currently in place. This paper's dual focus on transport planning as an academic discipline *and* a vocational practice is designed to the address the dissonance between research and practice.

But why focus on active modes? In the transport planning literature there has been much written about sustainability but less focus on active modes specifically, despite strong evidence on the ability of these modes to deliver health and environmental benefits *simultaneously* at low cost. This unique mix of 'co-benefits' from of active travel is something that 'techno fixes' are unable to provide, especially in an age of austerity and finite resources. Electric cars, for example, are in fact coal-fired cars when driven in the majority of countries where this most polluting of energy sources has yet to be phased out [@van_vliet_energy_2011]. Further, electric cars cannot deliver the health benefits of walking and cycling. Bus rapid transit schemes, to provide another example, can encourage walking [@lemoine_transmilenio_2016] but can be costly [@wirasinghe_bus_2013].

The marginalisation of walking and cycling in transport planning has led to work seeking to tackle this imbalance: the importance of cycling for a sustainable future is clearly not reflected by the amount of attention, let alone funding, cycle friendly transport interventions receive. One of the most cogent and widely cited papers in this area is @pucher_making_2008, who use evidence from three countries where a high (10% or more) proportion of trips are made by cycling (The
Netherlands, Denmark and Germany) to illustrate the kinds of policies that make cycling 'irresistable'. The authors focus on policies in these nations (in contrast to the USA) rather than the transport planning *process*, the focus of the present paper. Beyond cycling being acknowledged as an important mode in central government (a factor over which most planners have limited control), @pucher_making_2008 found that subtle factors (beyond simply building segregregated cycle paths) played an important role in making cycling an attractive option. These included investment in and management of cycle parking facilities; good integration with public transport; cycle training for all children and extensive training of car drivers; *strict liability* (a legal device which uses a hierarchy of assumed responsibility whereby the larger and more dangerous vehicle is assumed to be responsible for road traffic casualties until proven otherwise); and a range of measures to discourage car dependency in urban areas.

There is a substantial body of research into the social and psychological factors preventing people from walking and cycling. This research body recognises that mode choice is personal decision, often influenced by structural factors linked to car-orientated transport systems.   @pooley_policies_2013, for example, found that the widespread perception of cycling as a dangerous and unnusual mode of transport discouraged its wider uptake in the English towns of Leeds, Leicester, Worcester and Lancaster. The policy recommendations that flow from this evidence coincide with those of @pucher_making_2008 and include: a safe physical environment; legistlating for motorists' consideration for active modes; and land use policies to encourage more local economic activity [@pooley_policies_2013].

@geus_psychosocial_2008 provided a quantitative evidence base about the psychological, social and environment factors affecting cycling uptake. In support of @pooley_policies_2013, the study suggested that a combination of high quality infrastructure and supportive social and policy framework was effective in encouraging cycling uptake. Of relevance to transport planners, @geus_psychosocial_2008 found that proximity to parks and other green spaces was associated with more cycling, implying that exposure to traffic and unfriendly urban environments is a substantial barrier. The implication is that directing cycle paths through parks and off busy roads could make cycling more attractive, particularly for people for whom perceived danger and self-esteem is a barrier. This finding was supported in a more recent natural experiment of cycling uptake for commuting following the implementation of an off-road cycle path [@heinen_changes_2015].

@buehler_bikeway_2016 synthesised the evidence on the impacts of cycle infrastructure interventions, on *links* (e.g. cycle paths), *nodes* (e.g. road intersection treatments) and entire cycle *networks*, on cycling uptake. Overall it was found that there was a strong evidence base linking cycling infrastructure to higher rates of cycling. However, evidence on the relative importance of different types of intervention, particularly in relation to node, network and non-infrastructural interventions, was limited. From a planning perspective, @buehler_bikeway_2016 recommend that practitioners should seek to employ more network-level measures of cycling provision. A network-level approach to cycle planning could help create more joined-up cycling interventions to tackle barriers across the entire travel network. This differs from many cycle plans, which have tended to focus attention along a few specific (and in some cases arbitrarily selected) travel corridors.

To summarise this section, there are reasons to focus on cycling as a key part of a wider sustainable transport strategy, yet few academic papers have focused cycling can be embedded in the transport planning process. 
Research on mode choice suggests that a range of barriers block cycling uptake in many contexts. These operate at many levels, from national transport priorities down to personal self esteem (wich can in turn be influenced by transport infrastructure).
Framing cycle planning in terms of how to remove these barriers can help to assess the range of options at the outset of the planning process, rather than homing in on a single intervention (e.g. provision of cycle paths or advertising the benefits of cycling) at the outset.
The logical next question, from the perspective of transport planning practitioners, is 'how?'. Specifically, how to acheive the prioritised ellimination of the most damaging barriers to cycling in local and regional transport plans? Before tackling this question it is important to understand the historical reasons for the marginalisation of active modes in the discipline. This is covered in the next section.

# The marginalisation of cycling in transport policy

In their comprehensive history of transport modelling, @boyce_forecasting_2015 demonstrate that the field emerged in a very specific, and one could say unusual, context: the explosive growth of suburbia and car dependency in the USA. Despite the fact that the transport needs of society, perceived and real, have progressed substantially beyond the accomodation of endless growth in car use, this historical legacy still exerts an enormous influence over transport models and the practice of transport planning. Although the question it is clear that the intentions of these early modellers were admirable, it is clear that the outcomes --- a predict and provide paradigm leading to decades of grid-lock, pollution and road traffic casualties --- were sub-optimal. It is revealing to note that cycling is barely mentioned in @boyce_forecasting_2015. If history is written by the winners, the car is undoubtedly the winning mode of transport in the history of transport planning.

The informal acronym SLOPE (space left over after planning ends) has been used to describe the reasons underlying the physical marginalisation of cycling infrastructure on the transport network.

The previous has been more recent 

## The beginnings of a new paradigm?

@banister_sustainable_2008 suggested that the current transport planning paradigm was not conducive to delivering sustainable policies. To remedy this situation a series of reforms were suggested...

# Opportunities for embedding active travel at every stage in the planning process

Transport planning is not a linear process. It is iterative. The insights gleaned from plans that have been implemented should feed back into subsequent plans in a cyclicle process [@ortuzar_modelling_2001]. The transport planning cycle does have an order, however, as illustrated in figure \@ref(fig:stages). These five stages build on the 8 stages described by @ortuzar_modelling_2001, with the four stages they use use to describe modelling (contruction, generation, forecasting and testing) merged into one, and with the addition of public engagement. This addition reflects the shift to more participatory methods in transport planning @banister_sustainable_2008. These stages are useful for thinking about how opportunities to embed active travel travel in transport planning exist at every stage in the process. Note that public engagement is discussed last not because it is the final stage (there is no final stage as the process is cyclicle) but because it relates to all the other stages.

It should be noted that the structure of this section was also influenced by @gallagher_planning_2014, who provide guidlines on planning for cycling. The report begins with the observation that cycling was a major mode of transport in the UK but has been 'neglected' by practitioners since the proliferation of cars in the 1950s and progresses to outline opportunities for embedding cycling in the following areas of transport planning practice: the regulatory context in which transport planning operates; strategic transport plans; the design of new transport networks and routes and the promotion of behavioural change. These suggestions are freely accessible to practitioners and the public, thanks to the Chartered Institution of Highways & Transportation, who commissioned the report and upladed the it on their website [ciht.org.uk](http://www.ciht.org.uk/en/media-centre/news/index.cfm/ciht-launches-new-planning-for-cycling-guidelines). The guidelines in @gallagher_planning_2014 are not repeated here. Instead, the section extends and generalises their recommendations that relate to the wider planning process, rather than those related to cycling interventions only.

Transport planning does not take place inside a vacuum but within a dynamic and often highly politicised institutional context. This is tacitly acknowledged by @ortuzar_modelling_2001, who put "formulation of the problem" at the beginning of their 8 stages. But how does the formulation occur? Often the 'framing' of the problem is a result of the institutional structures. For this reason this aspect of transport planning is discussed before the the other stages.

## Institutional structures

## Data collection and analysis

<!-- 'If you measure something it has value'. Or simlar quote. -->

Transport planning and the transport sector overall has traditionally been seen as an objective realm, where numbers speak louder than words. However, there are many ways to take human factors into account in transport planning, as described by @deegan_planning_2011. The authors developed a systematic approach for incorporating local knowledge into cycle network plans, to assist practitioners deal with the complexity of options available. Although modelling tools have advanced since the method was implemented (as described in the next section), there is no doubt that allowing space for community input can greatly enhance the design of pro-cycling interventions. During the course of the project, over 200 studies were conducted resulting in more than 2000 specific recommendations.

Undertaken between 2005 and 2007, before the term Big Data became widely used, @deegan_planning_2011 represents a form of crowd-sourced data, from some of the best informed residents of the local area. Additional advantages of this 'stakeholder led' approach include the engagement and 'buy-in' of the local community into new schemes before they are constructed, and the assurance that planners will visit the site in question, cycling. Incorporating human factors into the data collection process, as demonstrated in practice by @deegan_planning_2011, thus represents a major opportunity for embedding cycling at an early stage in the planning process.

## Modelling

Transport modelling was developed in largely in response to the policy question of how to accomodate for future increases car use [@boyce_forecasting_2015]. Due largely to this historical context, cycling has "generally been ignored in ... traffic management modelling and scheme implementation" [@deegan_planning_2011]. However, with the increased interest in cycling over the past few years, there have been efforts to better account for cycling in transport models. This provides a powerful opportunity for embedding cycling more firmly in transport planning. Models can have a large impact on real world outcomes, as the decision making process is heavily reliant on model results [@hollander_who_2015]. Making models that are better suited to the needs of cycling infrastructure and policy design therefore represents a major opportunity for embedding the mode at one of the earliest stages in the transport planning process. Before outlining these opportunities, it's worth mentioning four specific problems with current transport models. 

First, many transport models simply do not represent cycling as a distinct mode. There are models that group cycling and walking together into a single mode, greatly reducing their ability to generate realistic results for either mode. This is partly because cycles are difficult to represent on the road network: they are not constrained by the same rules that define where cars can and cannot go. (Cycles can be carried up stairs for example, something that is impossible for cars.)

Second, 



A recent development in the UK context, but which has the potential to scale internationally is the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT), funded by the UK's Department for Transport @lovelace_propensity_2016.

@payne_removing_2014

@transport_for_london_analysis_2010

@larsen_build_2013

A recurring cricism of transport models is that they are 'black boxes' [@saujot_making_2016]. 


## Implementation

@melia_urban_2015 used the term 'filtered permeability' to refer to small interventions that can make cycling more attractive than driving in urban areas.
